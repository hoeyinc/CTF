# picoCTF - picoGYM walkthrough: Beginner picoMini 2022

# Codebook

## Objectives

> - To be able to download and execute a python script

1. Start by downloading the required files using the Webshell
  
```console
  wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/code.py
  
  wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/codebook.txt
```
2. You can use the command `ls` to check that the relevant files have been downloaded locally. Make sure that both `code.py` and `codebook.txt` are in the same directory
3. Executing the python file `code.py` will then print the challenge flag. 
  You can do this by entering the following command 
```console
  python3 code.py
```

# fixme2.py

## Objectives

> - To be able to fix issues in a python script

1. Start by downloading the required python script using the Webshell
  ```console
  wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/65/fixme2.py
  ```
2. Run the python script `fixme2.py` to see what type of error is raised and take note of the line number on where the error is found
  ```console
  python3 fixme2.py
  ```
3. Fix the error in the python script by using a terminal editor
```console
vi fixme1.py
```

<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
With the python file opened, navigate to **line 22** and fix the incorrect Syntax. The conditional operator `if` in Python requires two equal signs instead of one.

```python
if flag == "":
print('String XOR encountered a problem, quitting.')
```

# serpentine.py

## Objectives

> - To be able to edit and exploit application code

1. Run `serpentine.py`. Try to select option `b`. Oh it didn't work, well we'll have to dive deeper into the code to get the flag.
2. Open `serpentine.py` in a terminal editor
3. Extract the flag

<details open>
  
<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
Was your first instinct to decode each individual byte in the flag and piece them together?

Well what if I told you there was an easier way! Let the program do the heavy lifting for you.

Notice in `line 20` that there is a method called `print_flag`. We just need to append it to the output when selecting option `b` on `line 69`.

# convertme.py

## Objectives

> - To be able to convert between decimal and binary

1. Start by downloading the required python script using the Webshell
2. Run the python script `convertme.py `
  ```console
  python3 convertme.py
  ```
3. Convert the decimal number to one in binary

<details open>
<summary>Hint?</summary>
<br>
You should see a randomly generated decimal value, converting this value into binary will provide the required flag. There are many websites available for converting decimal to binary, e.g. https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html

# Glitch Cat

## Objectives

> - To be able to use networking tool netcat
> - To be able to convert hex characters to ascii

1. netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. The command `nc` will allow us to connect to the the flag printing server using netcat
  ```console
  nc saturn.picoctf.net 51109
  ```
2. Like the challenge mentions, the service is broken. The printed flag contains ASCII characters, which are those `chr(0xXX)` values where XX is a integer number.
  To retrieve the correct format flag, we must convert these ASCII characters
3. The ASCII characters can be directly converted inside the Webshell using Python.

<details open>
<summary>Hint?</summary>
<br>

First open up Python in the webshell by entering the command `python3`. Then you may use the `print` function with the incorrected formatted flag to acquire the valid flag

# HashingJobApp

## Objectives

> - To be able to use networking tool netcat
> - To be able to carry out md5 hashing

1. netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. The command `nc` will allow us to connect to the the flag printing server using netcat
  ```console
  nc saturn.picoctf.net 57689
  ```
2. Using md5, hash the quote and provide it as an answer
3. Repeat this for the next 2 quotes too

<details open>
<summary>Hint?</summary>
<br>
  <br> To access the flag you must `md5 hash` a randomly generated string. This can be done in web apps like the following: https://www.md5hashgenerator.com, or in your command line by using the `md5sum` tool. 
  ```console
  echo -n 'string' | md5sum
  ```

# PW Crack 1

## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code

### Steps:

1. Open `level1.py` in your terminal
2. Go through the code line by line, ignoring the section that has been highlighted for you to ignore
  
<details open>
  
<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
Notice on `line 19` that the program runs a conditional check for the user's password. Fortunately for us the password is in plain text for us to copy.
  
</details>

3. Run `python3 level1.py level1.flag.txt.enc` and enter the correct password you have found when prompted
4. Congratulations! You have found the flag. Go ahead and submit it!

  
# PW Crack 2

## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code
> - To be able to convert from hexadecimal to ascii characters

1. Open `level2.py` in your terminal
2. Go through the code line by line, ignoring the section that has been highlighted for you to ignore. Do you notice anything _different_ this time?
  
<details open>
  
<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
Notice on `line 18` that the program runs a conditional check for the user's password. Unlike the previous challenge this is not in a human readable format. The prefix `0x` is used to denote hexadecimal bytes. Let's convert it to something readable by using this 

[online hexadecimal converter](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('0x'))

</details>

3. Convert the password to a regular ascii string
4. Run `level2.py level2.flag.txt.enc` and enter the correct password you have found when prompted
5. Congratulations! You have found the flag. Go ahead and sumbit it!
  
# PW Crack 3

## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code
> - To be able to conceptualise brute force attacks

1. Open `level3.py` in your terminal
2. Notice the list of potential passwords on `line 44`? You can try something called a brute force attack where you essentially go through the list of passwords and try them out until you stumble upon the correct one
  
<details open>
  
<summary>Want to learn more?</summary>
  
<br>
  
It may not seem particularly clever but it is very useful way of gaining the correct password/keys. Reason being that computers have advanced to the point where they can 'crack' a password in mere moments.

How do you counter this?
First off never hardcode secrets into your application code.
Secondly, always use a strong password to stave off these brute force attacks.

*Note do not enter your actual password into these types of websites, just make up your own to test with*

# PW Crack 4

## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code
> - To be able to conceptualise brute force attacks
> - To be able to create short scripts to carry out brute force attacks

1. Open `level4.py` in your terminal. Do you notice anything _different_? We are now dealing with more passwords that we can manually handle. I don't know about you but I don't want to sit here and type out every single password. Why not let the computer do it for us?
2. Try to edit the the program `level4.py` in your favourite terminal editor. Your aim is to figure out a way to go through the list of possible passwords.
  
<details open>
  
<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
Copy the `pos_pw_list` into the `level_4_pw_check` method.
From there create a **for loop** to go through the list of possible passwords

</details>

  
# PW Crack 5

This time our list of passwords have gotten much longer and are now placed in a completely separate file called `dictionary.txt`. How will we brute force it this time around?

## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code
> - To be able to conceptualise brute force attacks
> - To be able to create short scripts to carry out brute force attacks

1. Edit `level5.py` file to open the `dictionary.txt`
2. Use a **for loop** to iterate through the potential passwords in the dictionary
  
<details open>
  
<summary>Hint?</summary>
  
<br>
  
Try using pythons inbuilt function called `open()` to read the file. Its default behaviour is to read through the file line by line which is convenient for us since this is how the passwords are separated in `dictionary.txt`.

>Still stuck? Remember that there are invisible characters you have to be wary of. These are whitespace characters like ` \t\r\n` which affects the hashing of the string. You need to trim these before hashing.
